// my god. I just realised the keypad is the wrong idea. I would need 3 keypads which then i masywell use buttons. good gracious zorika. ******** AHHHHHthis was all unecessary :))

// I can't actually test this rn because i don't have actual power for the motors that doesn't mess up the arduino. I assume it'll work though because it seems good
