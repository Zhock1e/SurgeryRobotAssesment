// pretty much works. the code is a teeeny bit confused I reckon. It prints a 0 before the serial print but thats fixable LATER


//Create an object from keypadddddddd
Keypad keypad = Keypad( makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, Rows, Col );

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

//void headToToe()//the ring rolls on pin tracks from the patients head to their toes

//void headSpins() //the ring rotates the teable till it hits it // doesn't actually hit

//void aroundTheWorld(){ // cause the patient is obvi the world //spins
//  char key = keypad.getKey();// Read the key
//  Serial.print(key);
//  if (key == '0'){
//    Serial.println(key);
//    Serial.print("around the world to the left ");
 // }
//}
                      
         //at first the function would not work then i put it into the loop. I am now relising its cause i made the function but literally never called it in the loop jesssuss


void loop() {
    char key = keypad.getKey();// Read the key
  Serial.print(key);
  if (key == '0'){
